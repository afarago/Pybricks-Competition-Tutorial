# About the author

My name is Attila Farago, working in the software development industry for 20+ years and engaged with LEGO robotics for the past 10 years both on the coach and the judge roles.

I am enthusiastic about helping individuals and teams to grow to their best and also getting to know and learn from many all over the globe. For me learning, networking and helping others grow worth much more than winning.
