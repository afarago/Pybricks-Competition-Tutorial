## About the author

My name is Attila Farago, working in the software development industry for 20+ years and engaged with LEGO robotics for the past 10 years both on the coach and the judge roles in FIRST LEGO League and World Robot Olympiad as well.

I am enthusiastic about helping individuals and teams to grow to their best and also learn from many experts all over the world. For me learning, networking and helping grow others worth much more than winning.
