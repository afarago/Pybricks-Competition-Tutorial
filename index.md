My name is Attila Farago, I have been working in the software development industry for 20+ years and have engaged with LEGO robotics for the past 10 years both in the coach and the judge roles in FIRST LEGO League and World Robot Olympiad as well.

I am enthusiastic about helping individuals and teams to grow to their best and also learn from many experts all over the world. For me, learning, networking, and helping develop others are worth much more than winning.

# About this tutorial

In the next sections, you will get a hands-on tutorial to help you get started with Pybricks which in my experience is the best and most effective way to program your LEGO hub.

This tutorial focuses on specific competition aspects, while the authors of Pybricks are creating a tutorial on the site itself. I strongly recommend reading [the official tutorial](https://pybricks.com/learn) as well.

# Let's start

Let us begin the learning and create a joyful experience with consistent robot runs where you can focus on strategy!
