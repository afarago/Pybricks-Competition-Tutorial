This environment simplifies programming by orders of magnitude compared to the traditional blocky-based system. Additionally the way Pybricks uses the DriveBase object makes your robot more reliable.

We are grateful to the developers of PyBricks and recommend that you try this framework out in the next season.

Pybricks has made these capabilities also available in a block-based environment that is not completely free, but requires a recurring or one-time payment. I have purchased the license because we have gained so much from this framework simply wanted to experiment and pay back, and I recommend that if you can, you also support the further development of Pybricks.
